### Installation
Spunto is a plugin for [Hammerspoon](http://hammerspoon.org/). Once Hammerspoon is installed place the following into your `~/.hammerspoon/` directory
* spunto.lua
* spunto/en-ru.txt (if necessary)

after that add the followoing to somewhere on top of your `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua`
```
dofile("spunto.lua")
```

### Usage
By default Spunto comes only with support of MBPr 13" Russian keyboard layout.
But it can be easily modified by adding new layouts to `spunto/` directory (see `en-ru.txt` as an example) and changing DICT_PATH in `spunto.lua`

Once you finished up with your layout text file, you are ready to start.

By default:

* Press `F3` to change selected text or the last word if nothing is selected.
* Press `âŒ˜ + F3` to change whole line to the left of the cursor.

Hotkeys can be changed at the bottom of `spunto.lua`

### Requirements
* OS X El Capitan or newer
* Hammerspoon v0.9.52 or higher
* Accessibility Settings must be enabled for Hammerspoon
